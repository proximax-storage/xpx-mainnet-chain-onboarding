# Onboarding the Community into ProximaX Sirius MAINNET

This readme contains the official ProximaX instructions on how to use the community distribution for a Sirius Blockchain Peer.  The deployable Peer automatically hooks-up to ProximaX MAINNET, provided you setup the validator key (harvestKey).
